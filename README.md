Here's a detailed README template for your  E-commerce Product Management
 System project, 
based on the instructions and requirements provided:

E-commerce Product Management System
Introduction
The E-commerce Product Management System is a Node.js application designed to manage products in an e-commerce environment. It handles product inventory, allowing users to add, update, remove, and search for products. The system also includes inventory management features such as restocking and calculating the total inventory value. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript and Node.js to build a functional backend application.
Project Type
Backend

Deployed App
Currently, this project does not have a deployed version. It is a local Node.js application.

Attach a very short video walkthrough of the codebase [1 - 5 minutes]

Features
•  Add Product: Add products to the inventory with properties like ID, name, category, price, and stock quantity.
•  Update Product: Update existing product details such as price and stock quantity.
•  Remove Product: Remove a product from the inventory by its ID.
•  Search by Category: Search for products within a specific category.
•  Search by Price Range: Search for products within a specified price range.
•  Manage Inventory: Restock products that fall below a certain stock threshold.
•  Calculate Inventory Value: Calculate the total value of all products in the inventory.
Design Decisions or Assumptions
•	Modular Code: The code is modularized into separate files for better management.
•	ES6 Syntax: ES6 import/export syntax is used for module management.
•	Hard-Coded Data: Example data is hard-coded for demonstration and testing purposes.
•	Restocking Logic: Restocking logic is included with a simple rule to add 10 units when stock is below the threshold.
Installation & Getting Started
1.	Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ecommerce-product-management.git
2.	Navigate into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd ecommerce-product-management
3.	Install Node.js if it's not already installed.
4.	Initialize the project:
bash
Copy code
npm init -y
5.	Create the necessary files (Product.mjs, helpers.mjs, test.mjs) and add the code as described in the instructions.
Usage
1.	Run the application:
bash
Copy code
node Product.mjs
2.	Test the functionality:
bash
Copy code
node test.mjs
Include screenshots or example outputs as necessary.

Credentials
For authenticated pages (if applicable), provide user credentials here.
APIs Used
No external APIs are used in this project.
API Endpoints
This project does not include an API as it is a local Node.js application.
Technology Stack
•	Node.js: JavaScript runtime used for building the application.
•	JavaScript: Programming language used to develop the backend logic.
•	ES6 Modules: For modular code management.
Code Structure and Testing
•	Product Class: Defined in Product.mjs, handles all product management logic.
•	Main Script: helpers.mjs contains helper functions like displaying the welcome message.
•	Testing: test.mjs contains test cases to verify the functionality of methods in the Product class.
